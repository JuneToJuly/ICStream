## Project Description (3-4 Sentences)
ICStream is a basic video live-streaming service that allows users to either broadcast or view video. It falls under 
the client-server architecture: streamer clients push video to the server, and the server then pushes that video to viewer clients. The app requires a degree of concurrency that would allow multiple viewers to consume one streamer's content at the same time, as well as allow multiple independent streamers to simultaneously push their video content to a single server. In popular culture, live streaming applications have become staples of social media, video game entertainment, virtual meetings, and more. 

## Building and Running
Throughout the development of the project, we have utilized IntelliJ's run configurations to build and run the app directly in our IDEs. This coupled with the fact that the app relies on local video files and an MP4 modification executable (also local), it would be difficult to replicate and run the project on one's own. For this reason, we have scheduled an office demonstration.
